# Redux Toolkit TypeScript Example

This example shows how to integrate Next.js with [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org).

The **Redux Toolkit** is a standardized way to write Redux logic (create actions and reducers, setup the store with some default middlewares like redux devtools extension). This example demonstrates each of these features with Next.js

## Deploy your own

Deploy the example using [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example):

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-redux&project-name=with-redux&repository-name=with-redux)

## How to use

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-redux with-redux-app
```

```bash
yarn create next-app --example with-redux with-redux-app
```

```bash
pnpm create next-app --example with-redux with-redux-app
```

Deploy it to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).

## Docker

You can also run the example in a Docker container. Run the following command to build the image:

```bash
docker build -t nextauth/frontend:v1 .
```

Then run the image:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 3000:3000 --name nextauth nextauth/frontend:v1
```

Access is available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
